;; Not a unit test — an EXECUTABLE end-to-end demo/test that must genuinely
;; pass when run, matching kotoba-lang/dtn's

;; real bytes, PASS/FAIL per scenario, a final "RESULT: N/M scenarios
;; passed" line, process exit 0 iff all passed.

;; Proves nostr.relay.transport's hand-rolled RFC 6455 WebSocket handshake
;; and frame codec against a REAL client socket driving the REAL client
;; side of the protocol (this test file's own minimal WS client, built on
;; node:net + node:crypto — same zero-npm-dependency discipline as the
;; server, and it deliberately reuses transport.cljs's own
;; try-decode-frame/encode-frame primitives rather than a second
;; hand-rolled parser, so a bug in decoding isn't independently duplicated
;; and masked): scenario 1 connects, sends a client-MASKED EVENT text
;; frame, and receives an OK text frame. Scenario 2 proves REQ live
;; fan-out: a second connection subscribes, a first connection publishes a
;; matching event, and the subscriber receives it as an unsolicited EVENT
;; push — not just the static REQ/EOSE query path.
