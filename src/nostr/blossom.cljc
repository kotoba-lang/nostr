  "NIP-98 HTTP Auth + Blossom BUD-01/02 blob storage
  (ADR-2607172210's nostr.blossom, KRP §16.3: a Blossom blob's sha256 is
  Content identity, KRP §3.3 — a domain-specific content hash, not a CID).

  Storage: one IStore collection, :nostr.blossom/blobs, keyed by lowercase
  hex sha256, holding {:bytes :content-type :uploaded-at :uploaded-by}. This
  mirrors the {:bytes :content-type} shape
  kotobase-protocols/src/kotobase/protocols/blocks.cljc uses for its shared
  content-addressed block space (this repo does not depend on that repo —
  same shape for consistency, not code reuse), plus two Blossom-specific
  fields.

  SCOPE (v0.1, honest about what's real vs. simplified — same discipline as
  kotobase-protocols' own README):
    - PUT /upload does NOT require NIP-98 auth (matches many real Blossom
      servers' public-upload policy, and is what this repo's owning ADR
      literally specifies: only DELETE is called out as requiring auth).
      When an Authorization header IS present on upload, it's still
      verified and, if valid, its pubkey is recorded as :uploaded-by.
    - DELETE /<sha256> REQUIRES a valid NIP-98 auth event (kind 27235,
      method DELETE, u = this request's URL, fresh created_at). It does
      NOT additionally check that the deleting pubkey matches
      :uploaded-by (ownership enforcement) — any holder of a validly-signed,
      freshly-timestamped auth event for this exact URL can delete. This is
      a real, disclosed v0.1 gap (a production Blossom server should add
      ownership checks), not a silently-skipped requirement.
    - Bodies are strings (binary upload is a follow-up), same documented
      limitation nostr.http/kotobase-protocols' http.cljc carries.
    - GET is fully public, no auth, matching Blossom's read model."
